# hello-world
Just followed the tutorial.

Well, it's 23:00 now and I've had another unproductive day, just like what I've done for the past few weeks.
It is really the time to have some efficiency, since it is such a shame to waste my time like this. I don't know if I will ever be able to have a chance to learn stuff like this in the future.
Oh, I'd love to have some tacos. They must be great.
